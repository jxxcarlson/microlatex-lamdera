do you know about this awesome frontend language that really rocks? I've been told it's pretty cool, and is named after a tree

Elm altered the course of my life: i can't use anything else for frontend dev now, it infuriates me all day long
Carlos Saltos4:22 PM
Love Brasil !!
Mathieu AGOPIAN4:23 PM
i even tried the last toy cool kids use (svelte), but it still irritated me :(
Laurent Payot4:23 PM
Elm made my programming in other languages painful ^^
You4:23 PM
Mario, Evan, re life -- yes, it has given me a reinvigorated intellectual life, lots of fun, and the chance to get to know people in an amazing community.
Can't access the mic, hence the text message
Carlos Saltos4:23 PM
Yes, doing other languages knowing Elm exists it's more a pain
Casper4:23 PM
Yes, the ideas in elm have been very effectful ;-)
Mario Rogic4:24 PM
Dropping a message in here is also great! Might save us some time :D
Carlos Saltos4:24 PM
With Elm I get confidence to create my first online class on Udemy, I love it !!
Jeroen Engels4:24 PM
TAKE THE CREDIT, EVAN! JUST TAKE IT! :D
Sam Tracey4:24 PM
I managed to switch careers at the age of 44 from chemistry teaching to web development. That was almost completely  due to learning Elm and attending Elm Cambridge Meetup.
Dillon Kearns4:24 PM
That would be an impure state change Jeroen!
Katja4:25 PM
I would have left programming were it not for this community. I was getting pretty burned out with mainstream tech and web dev when I met some folks in Paris a few years back.
E Nadinda Rachmat4:25 PM
Elm bridge changed my life ❤️
Carlos Saltos4:25 PM
Great Martin !!
Fabian4:26 PM
I'm still suffering with C#...
Augustin Ragon4:26 PM
I thought that my programming career was gonna leave me bored and burnt-out after only 3 years getting back to it, and instead I found Elm and have been loving my job for the past 6 years <3
Sylvain Brunerie4:26 PM
Thanks for bringing back the fun in (functional) programming. Just started introducing Elm at work and it’s really saving me and (I think) the project I’m working on.
Thanks to Katia by the way for this, you motivaded me to actually do it!
Basile Henry4:26 PM
I enjoyed the few Elm Cambridge Meetups I attended, very welcoming folks :)
Sylvain Brunerie4:26 PM
*Katja
Tomas Latal4:26 PM
Diving into Elm was the best decision I have ever made (Pushed to it by Terezka's talk at Elm Europe in Paris 2016 actually)! It lead to me starting to be contractor, I'm at my 2nd Elm full time job now, I lead several workshops on it and met wonderful people... It was a ride and it is not ending anytime soon!!!
Katja4:27 PM
Yeah using Elm does make my one remaining non-Elm commitment (Vue) very stressful.
Basile Henry4:27 PM
(might be the other Cambridge ^^)
Ed Kelly4:27 PM
I think not just Elm, but specifically the Elm London Meetup changed my life. When I was a teenager in the 90s I programmed in BASIC, but I didn't really know anyone else who was interested in programming. So I gave up and went down a different path. In my 30s, I took up programming again, found Elm, plucked up my courage to go to a meetup, and now I feel part of a community with a whole new set of friends.
Henrique Buss4:27 PM
Elm got me my first job ever! I was so passionate about it that I had created a bunch of projects, and my now coworkers were really happy with my excitement and decided to hire me
Austin Erlandson4:28 PM
I'll say the same but inverse... writing Elm is like building with bricks instead of trying to make castles out of sand. It's a HUGE relief that keeps me productive day in and day out.
Alex Perkins4:28 PM
"email client" every time a new article hits Hacker News this is the bottommost comment
Tomasz Szwarczyński4:28 PM
Do you know that your last name is Polish? And Tereza's also. They are bird base, so Evan is Heron and Tereza is Falcon
Dzhalil Akbashev4:28 PM
Elm is a reason I’ve started learning FP, now don’t even consider myself as an iOS developer (even though still write in Swift 🤷‍♂️) 
Actually don’t know who (professionally) I’m right now 😅
Dillon Kearns4:28 PM
Working with Elm has made my ADHD brain feel at peace trying to keep less in my head.
Austin Erlandson4:28 PM
^
Carlos Saltos4:29 PM
Yes, great for help with ADHD
Katja4:29 PM
Ed we're still here. Gonna resurrect the London meetup one day soon. It did the same for me. Massive confidence boost, validation to be part of this community where we can just be us and write OK code.
Nick Boultbee4:29 PM
Yay for Elm London! ❤
Mario Rogic4:29 PM
I’m back in London mid-April onwards (permanentishly) so definitely we’re cracking on again!
Michel Belleville4:29 PM
ELM motivated me to really get Haskell and start working on Elixir.
Julian Miguel Antonielli4:30 PM
“Kinda mid at programming” also describes me
Jonathan Jouty4:30 PM
@Mark Skipper: so it is the *original* Cambridge. Is there still a meetup? I live in Cambridge and would love to join / help organise.
Conrad Taylor4:30 PM
Back in 2016 or 2017, I was first introduced to Elm by Richard Feldman at a Meetup in SF.  Elm has definitely set the bar for how a compiler should help the developer.  Now, if I have to do frontend stuff, I just want to do it in Elm.
Michel Belleville4:30 PM
Also, gave me the best 1.5 year working front-end without one bug.
