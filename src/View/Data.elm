This is a demo app for the experimental markup language MicroLaTeX.

\\italic{To see what
you can do with L0, compare the left and right windows (source
and rendered text)}.  Clicking on text on the right brings the
corresponding text on the left into view.  For the reverse,
highlight text on the left and click the \\bold{\\blue{Sync}} button,
lower left.

You can also click on the titles in \\bold{\\blue{Published docs}} (right column) to see what has been written already in MicroLaTeX.


\\italic{\\blue{Try out MicroLaTeX now: just begin typing in the left window. Delete all the text if you want.
Don't worry â€” your edits won't be saved, since you don't own this document.}}

\\b{First examples}


1. A link: \\link{New York Times https://nytimes.com}

2. An image
\\image{https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rr6Xg.jpg}

3. Some math: Pythagoras sez $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  In class we
learned that

$$
\\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}
$$

4. Some code: `a[0} := a[0} + 1`.  A block of code:

\\begin{code}
>>> for i in range(1,5):
...   print(i, i*i)
...
1 1
2 4
3 9
4 16
\\end{code}
