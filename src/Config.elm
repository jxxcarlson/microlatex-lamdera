[b [large Technical Info]]

Scripta.io is written in [link Elm https://elm-lang.org] using
the [link Lamdera framework https://dashboard.lamdera.app/],
so that both the frontend and backend run on Elm. For
the editor we use [link Codemirror 6 https://codemirror.net/6/] and for rendering of mathematical formulas, we use
[link KaTeX https://katex.org].

The Scripta codebase weighs in at about 10K lines of code,
two-thirds of which is the text-to-html compiler.
The [ilink Scripta compiler id-hx574-zz554] maps source
text in any one of the three designated markup languages to
a language-independent syntax tree.

The compiler has fairly good error-handling characteristics.
Syntax errors are discreetly noted in the rendered text in
real time;  the text below a block which has an error is rendered
normally.

The compiler will be released as open source software as soon as
it stops changing so quickly.

[b [large Acknowlegements]]

I would like to acknowledge and thank the many people from whom I
have learned and who have shared their knowledge and insight
with me over the course of the developing Scripta.  In roughly
chronological order: Evan Czaplicki, Ilias van Peer, Mario Rogic,
Nicholas Yang, Matt Griffith, and Rob Simmons and team at Brilliant.org.
